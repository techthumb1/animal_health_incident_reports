# Global Animal Health Incident Reports (2005â€“2025)

## A Longitudinal Analysis of Outbreak Trends, Species Vulnerability, and Surveillance Behavior

This dataset contains standardized animal disease incident reports submitted to the World Organisation for Animal Health (WAHIS) over a 20-year period. It provides structured insight into:

- Disease frequency and evolution
- Country-level reporting behavior
- Affected species distribution
- Temporal trends in surveillance and outbreak occurrence

The goal is to help researchers, analysts, and public health stakeholders understand how global animal health systems respond to risk, and where vulnerabilities persist.
